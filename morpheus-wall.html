		<h2>The Relapse Cycle</h2>
		<p>
			The majority of the population set rules to live their best life. But that's hard and they stop. They acknowledge that stopping is bad and start again. And I am no exception. And that's not ok. It's no excuse that everybody does that. You are not everyone nor everybody. It's not okay to not strive for your goals. It's not okay to rot till your inevitable death. Wake up.
		</p>
		<h2>Time Waste</h2>
		<p>
			We are all going through our lives, maybe thinking that we spend our time reasonably. That we need to watch YouTube to relax or that we need to watch this series. No, you don't. You are effectively wasting your time on something that, in the long run, doesn't give you happiness. You won't be proud that you watched three hours of YouTube per day. I myself am a victim of this time wastage. If we focus on what we do in a day, we find that we waste our precious time on something that is pointless. Creative, valuable work brings happiness into our lives.

		<p>
			So, you, I, and we need to start paying attention to the things we do daily and improve our daily schedules. But don't mistake a schedule for a jail. Most people now open their calendar and start planning: "I need to do this, this, this, and this." They fully pack their calendar with no free time, nothing. Because in the calendar, you see empty space and think to yourself: "Empty box, nothing to do, uga buga." But you are making the perfect jail for yourself. Create a schedule that you enjoy, that you want to do, and slowly wedge in some discomfort. Because at the end of the day, there are things that need to be done, and you can't afford not to do them. TLDR: Live your life with purpose.
