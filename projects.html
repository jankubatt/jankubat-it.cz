                        Kopcuj web app focuses on getting track of your climbed hills in Czechia. Mark your hills as climbed 
                        and rate them with stars. You can report an issue on the path or discuss topics on the discussions page. 
                        Initial development started in summer 2020. Since then I solo developed this app. I learned a lot starting 
                        with JQuery till now with React. I decided, that I want to include this project in my seminar work in school. 
                        If you want to try out this project feel free to do so.

                        BakaBot is a Discord bot written in Python that interacts with Bakalari.cz, a web-based school information 
                        system used in the Czech Republic. This bot fetches data about substitution and communicates it to users 
                        in a Discord channel. BakaBot can be configured to send regular updates or can be triggered manually to provide 
                        real-time information about substitutions. The bot's ability to provide quick and reliable information makes 
                        it a useful tool for students and teachers alike. Additionally, BakaBot's source code is open-source, allowing 
                        for further customization and development.

                        Morpheus Systems is a project that combines servers, networks, hosting, and home automation. It includes sensors, 
                        a NAS, and a home assistant system to provide a centralized interface for controlling smart home devices. The sensors 
                        provide data for automation, making it more efficient and convenient. All of these systems are managed by me. I try to 
                        practice my sysadmin skills by managing these systems.
